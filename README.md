# Kudaloan-Loan-Default-Analysis-ML-

Kudaloan, a fintech firm, is transforming
the conventional lending sector by providing
state-of-the-art loans.

Using cutting-edge technology and advanced
analytics, Kudaloan delivers swift, convenient,
and cost-effective loans to both individuals and
businesses. With simplified procedures and an
easy-to-use platform, borrowers can quickly apply
for and obtain loans within minutes. Kudaloan's
interest rates are highly competitive, and they
provide flexible repayment options that alleviate
the burden of complicated paperwork and long
waiting periods.


Kudaloan, a loan provider, has
noticed that several of their customers are
failing to repay their loans.
As a solution, Kudaloan intends to construct
a machine learning (ML) model capable of
precisely forecasting which customers are
prone to default on their loans. This approach
would permit Kudaloan to identify
potentially high-risk customers beforehand
and take proactive measures to decrease
their default rate.
The objective is to create an ML model that
can effectively anticipate which customers
are likely to default on their loans, allowing
Kudaloan to proactively decrease their
default rate.
